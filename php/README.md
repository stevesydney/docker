# PHP-FPM Container

This container has php-fpm installed with a bunch of extensions.

It's ready to run Wordpress when linked to the `stevesydney/mysql-dev` container. It listens on port 9000 for nginx requests.

It also has xdebug configured with the required settings for [codebug.app]: http://codebugapp.com

It's simple and evident of the fact that I'm an absolute beginner.
